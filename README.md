What is wireframing 
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:
Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.

Facilitates Communication:
It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.

Focuses on Functionality and User Experience:

By stripping away visual design elements, wireframes allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.


Key Elements in a Wireframe

Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
